gulp-nunjucks-data
==================

Working in progress.
I've developed this plugin because I needed a plugin that do exactly what it's doing now; I'm using for that task and I expect in the next weeks to write a proper `README` and test, for now, the repo only contains what I've done it so far.

## Requeriments

It requires Node v6.x because the module is implemented with ES6 features supported by Node v6 out of the box.

## Installation

NOTE: it's already in NPM because it is very convenient to me to be able to use installed through it.

`npm install koa-flash-simple`
